## This repository provides a detailed walk-through and Scripts for GTEx integration work contributing to Massa et al., 2022
### All datasets for analyses are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FldQDp-I9NGqgBo0cW9WS3KuYCSeHDM7?usp=sharing
### Briefly, datasets include:


## The scripts to analyze are broken up into two parts:
#### 1: Computation of estrogen signaling proxies per individual in GTEx to infer "low" vs "high" estrogen action: estrogen gene set across tissues.R
#### 2: Crosstissue correlation scores from Adipose, Skeletal Muscle and Stomach to Hypothalamus female-specific DEGs derived from mice: pathways and tissue-specific binning for low vs high estrogen.R
